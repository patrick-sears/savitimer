savitimer is meant to be used with the SAVA video capture system
used to measure ciliary beat frequency (CBF) with a microscope.
savitimer is used to keep track of when SAVA videos can be saved.
After adjusting the focus on the microscope, a delay is required
before videos can be saved.  This delay can be calculated from
the frame capture rate and the number of frames to be saved.
savitimer creates a GUI window with a button that can be clicked
to start the timer before the SAVA "save" button can be hit.
It divides the time into the following periods:
- In the initial period, a few frames should not be saved as
  the microscope table stabilizes.
- Then there is the period while frames are collected.
- Finally there is a period during which the video can be
  saved.  During this time it is sometimes necessary to wait
  for a particular event to be seen, for example to capture
  flowing particles for speed measurements.  But it may be
  necessary to take the video within a specified time period
  because of changing conditions.
